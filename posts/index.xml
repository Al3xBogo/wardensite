      <description>WardenSMP is a Minecraft Java survival server with plenty to do! We are starting our 4th season on June 16th, and plan to stick with the vanilla survival game!
The website has been made pink to match with the new Cherry Grove biome in the 1.20 Trails &amp;amp; Tales Update!
Please note that this is a closed sever, so only people that know the owner or have been invited by a member are permitted to join.</description>
